# Variable-Font Video

Another variable font experiment to overlay text on and animate along a video. The animation depends on the font. The most common one is to vary weights, which should visually match the original video's pixel color intensities.

The sample video is a portion of a music video by Cadson Demak, a leading font studio in Thailand.
